        <p>The University of Tokyo {Feb '13 - Sep '14}</p>
        <p>Advisor: <a href="http://ytlab.jp/index.html">Yoshinori Tamada</a></p>
        <p>Skills used: C, OpenMP on many-core architecture (Xeon Phi)</p>
        <p>Conducted research on how to make the estimation of large scale Bayesian networks parallely scalable. Most Bayesian network applications, like decision networks, rely only on the estimation of a few tens of variables. Some applications, frequently in computational biology, require estimation for networks with thousands of variables. I made an effort to study how to tradeoff accuracy while speeding up modern computational methods enough to allow estimation of networks for applications with large scale needs.</p>

        <p><a href="{{'/media/proposal.pdf'}}">Original Proposal</a></p>
        <p>I conducted brief research into increasing the computing scale of multiple kernel learning in Support Vector Machine (SVM) implementations. I became interested in SVM learning after studying character recognition applications in some independent study projects and wanted to continue formal study in a graduate course.

        <p>This research focuses on the use of mathematical models to study questions concerning Alaska's Boreal ecosystem with the goal of addressing issues of interest to resource management. My role in this project involved integrating a predation model developed by Professor Feng into the landscape modeling software <a href="http://www.snap.uaf.edu/resource_page.php?resourceid=11">ALFRESCO</a> and matching simulation output to empirical research findings. This was a multidisciplinary joint project between Purdue University and the University of Alaska Fairbanks involving a team of mathematicians, ecologists, statisticians and computer scientists.<!--I began working with Professor Feng in the Fall of 2010 as part of an undergradute research program through Purdue University's <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/dp/">Discovery Park</a>.--></p>

        <p>Skills used: Embedded C (ARM board), Visual C++ (data visualization on desktop PC)</p>
        <p>Professor Chung's lab was working with engineers at Delta
        Electronics to develop a handheld medical device utilizing photon
        scattering in skin tissue as a tool for detecting tumors. I worked on an algorithm to
        determine tissue parameters (volume fraction of water, fat, etc.) based
        on reflection of light in multilayer tissue at specific wavelengths.
        This was done through the application of the Nelder-Mead simplex
        algorithm (implemented in C) and least squares fitting to fit the skin
        parameters to spectral data.
